# ColorToolVT2024
It is to calculate/analysis/optimize all of color quality, light quality and relevant things of light sources, images, cameras and color sensors.
It is a private programme of Dr. Vinh Trinh, does not correlate his current position of his company or the old companies. The copyright belongs to him privately.

There are 11 items in the structure of this software including: 
	1-File 			      	2-Setting			3-Corner Color TCSs
	4-Correlations 			5-Generate 			6-Corner ISD
	7-Tools extra	 	  	8-Color Sensor			9-Corner CS2000
	10-Corner Rp,TUD 2018		11-Corner HCL			12- About 		
	13-Stop urgently (ST).

A) Simple modes: "About" and "Format 4 input Data" are simple items so that users can understand information about this software, vesion, author and the format of input data 
including txt and xls file.

B) Basic modes:
1- "Setting 4 IES" in "Setting" is to give setting of the calculation of IES-TM30-15.
2- "other Parameters" in "Setting" to set other parameters for Color memory.
3- "Draw Option" in "Setting" is control the drawing. 
4- "Corner ISD is to process ISD file and make them into avaiable xls files for further uses.

C) Main Modes:
1- Calculating Color in the "File" is to calculate all about color quality and light quality.
2- "Corner Color TCSs" is to process everything concerning to test color samples.
3- "Correlations" is to find the correlations between color metrics with the format that this software has given.
4- "Generate" is to generate the spectra about semiconductor LEDs, pc-LEDs and the standard spectra.
5- "Color Sensor" is to matrizieren wiht color sensors.
6- "Corner CS2000" is to connect and measure with Camera CS2000.
7- "Corner Rp,TUD 2018" is to calculate and synthesize for the model color preferences of TU Darmstadt.
8- "Corner HCL" is to calculate and synthesize for the model HCLs.

D) The most important mode: Calcuating Color in the "File" is frequently used so that all color metrics can be calculated from the input data.

E) The additional item "Tools extra" is added on 20.10.2016. This item is used to help you in converting from n-nm-spectra into 1-nm-spectra and inversely. 
It will be developed further for more tools such as the addition, substration, dividition and multiplition of spectra or determination of reflectance spectrum of colors.

F) "Stop urgently" with the red text "ST" is to stop timer in the case of long term measurements and others.

Vinh will write this continuously.
